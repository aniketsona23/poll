### Morning (10:00 AM - 1:00 PM)
- **Team Meeting**: Analyzed assignment requirements and decided on Functional-OO architecture.
- **Aniket**: Designed the `ListContainer` hierarchy and `GenericList` skeleton.
- **Vanshaj**: Set up the project structure, Maven configuration, and Git repository.
- **Vedant**: Researched `JavaParser` library and created initial prototypes for AST traversal.
- **Mayukh**: Implemented the build system (`Makefile`, `pom.xml`) and directory layout.

### Afternoon (2:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
- **Aniket**: Implemented core functional operations (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) in `GenericList`.
- **Vanshaj**: Implemented `Stack` and `Queue` containers extending `ListContainer`.
- **Vedant**: Developed the `Scanner` class for BFS directory traversal.
- **Mayukh**: Created unit tests for `GenericList` and `Stack` to ensure correctness early.

### Evening (8:00 PM - 11:00 PM)
- **Aniket**: Integrated `Scanner` and `Parser` into the core `Index` class.
- **Vanshaj**: Implemented `Deque` container and added more tests.
- **Vedant**: Finalized `Parser` logic to extract Class, Method, and Field info models.
- **Mayukh**: Designed and implemented `PriorityQueueCustom` using a binary heap.

## November 25, 2025

### Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)
- **Aniket**: Designed the CLI `Command` interface and `Main` entry point.
- **Vanshaj**: Started implementation of the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).
- **Vedant**: Implemented `GrepCommand` with regex support.
- **Mayukh**: Implemented `SortCommand` and `KeywordsCommand` using the Priority Queue.

### Afternoon (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM)
- **Aniket**: Implemented `AnalyzeCommand` and `ListCommand`.
- **Vanshaj**: Added command history feature to REPL using `Stack`.
- **Vedant**: Added `InspectCommand` for detailed file/class inspection.
- **Mayukh**: Implemented `AggregateCommand` for codebase statistics.

### Evening (7:00 PM - 10:00 PM)
- **Aniket**: Refined functional operations and optimized `GenericList`.
- **Vanshaj**: Conducted integration testing of the REPL with all commands.
- **Vedant**: Added `MetricsCommand` for individual file analysis.
- **Mayukh**: Implemented `ExportCommand` for JSON/CSV output.

## November 26, 2025

### Morning (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM)
- **Team**: Final bug fixes and performance tuning.
- **Aniket**: Finalized architecture documentation.
- **Vanshaj**: Polished REPL user experience (prompts, help messages).
- **Vedant**: Verified `Grep` and `Scanner` edge cases.
- **Mayukh**: Created the demonstration bundle and build scripts (`run.sh`).

### Afternoon (12:00 PM - 2:00 PM)
- **Team**: Final review of deliverables.
- **Aniket**: Created `README.md` and `docs/COMMANDS.md`.
- **Mayukh**: Created `Timeline.md` and `GenAI_Usage.md`.
- **All**: Recorded demonstration video (planned).
